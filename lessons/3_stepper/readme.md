I was trying to get the stepper code work but nothing was happening. Turns out one of the wire was defective. Lesson learned. Always check wire before using.

The next thing is to learn how to make a circuit using battery and breadboard.

This setup worked without conecting the ground to the arduino board. Do not know if this is safe.
